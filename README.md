Chloé is the tiny microcontroller for the casual. With a smaller form factor than 
the PicoDuino, a WS2812B LED and a low price, Chloé is the cutest microcontroller 
you'll ever own. 

Features:
* Full compatibility with Digispark software and bootloader
* WS2812B
* It's a keychain!
* Minimalistic top surface
* Breadboard-friendly headers
* Smaller than many USB sticks

Specifications: 
* ATtiny85
* Sized at 12.7mm by 24.4mm
* 6 IO pins, same as the Digispark
* 5V and GND pins (no VIN to keep it small. if you want to power it with a higher 
voltage, use an external 5V reg)
