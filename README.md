# Chloé - your cute microcontroller

Are you looking for a flashy microcontroller as a keychain, but don't want to hang 
an Arduino? Or are you in need of a tiny microcontroller to put in your next project? 
Or, want to show off your coding skills but don't want to buy an RGB LED and 
resistors? Need somthing portable for your next VUSB hack?

Chloé is the tiny microcontroller for the casual. With a smaller formfactor, a 
WS2812B LED and reduced cost than a Digispark, Chloé is the cutest microcontroller 
you'll ever own. 

Features:
* Full compatibility with Digispark software and bootloader
* WS2812B
* Minimal top surface
* ~Breadboard-friendly headers~ (The USB connector would block the pins :( )
* Smaller than many USB sticks

Specifications: 
* ATtiny85
* 6 IO pins, same as the Digispark
* 5V and GND pins (no VIN to keep it small. if you want to power it with a higher 
voltage, use an external 5V reg)
